<h2 class="fancy-header">Welcome to Our Domain</h2>
This is the digital home of the Hybrid Family, an organization which, until recently, was hidden from the minds of ordinary humans. It is a safe haven for all manner of creatures, but was founded for the protection of hybrids, those that come from many but belong to none.
<h2 class="fancy-header">Origin and Purpose</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Volkov Manor, once home to a renowned scholar, is now the residence of the elusive Hybrid Family.</li>
    <li>Within its walls, creatures from all corners of the world (and some from beyond its borders) live in peace and serenity.</li>
    <li>This harmony is the result of mutual trust between cryptids, mythics, hybrids, and enlightened humans.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="fancy-header">Safety and Conduct</h2>
In the event of misconduct among the residents, the staff, led by: <div><ul class="list contain"><li>Master Orpheus Balaur</li> and <li>Madame Scar Sandrine</li></ul></div> are well-equipped to handle this, and any other, situation that arises within the grounds.
<h2 class="fancy-header">Font of Knowledge</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>As a gesture of respect for the academic triumphs of the Manor's previous owner, the Hybrid Family offers an array of educational programs for both young and Awakened residents.</dt> <dd> In the spirit of Master Volkov, these scholarly experiences have been advanced to the rank of Ivy League.</dd>
